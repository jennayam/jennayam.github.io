            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Cones</p>
            
            <p>This company is a small batch ice cream shop that aims to simultaneously build community through a common childhood-like love of ice cream (dairy-free, vegan, &amp; sorbets also available)! Everything is homemade from scratch in order to taste the love put into this frozen treat. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The main target audience would be families, teenagers/young adults, &amp; elders. Ice cream can be eaten with a family as a desert or a special treat for the kids, teenagers/young adults will enjoy a scoop while hanging out with their friends, &amp; ice cream is an easy to eat, sweet treat to consume with grandkids. Although our product's audience has a wide range, I assume the specific age would range from 16-mid 60s &amp; anyone who is well-versed with online ordering. Obviously there are a lot of older &amp;younger people outside our age range that love ice cream, but in terms of the audience who would most benefit from our website would be people who have money to spend on a treat (aka parents) &amp; well-versed with technology (aka teenagers/young adults). </p>
           
            <p>With the pandemic currently, the target audience's goal to use this website is to preorder "ice cream kits" that will be ordered online for COVID safe pick up. In addition, it will be the site where pints can be pre-ordered for pick up as well. When things are back in person, this website will only be used to see what flavors will be offered as well as pre-ordered pint pick ups.</p>
