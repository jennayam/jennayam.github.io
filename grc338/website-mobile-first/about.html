                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a family owned coffee shop with a team centered on treating everyone like family. We like to think of our space as an extension of our living room open to whoever needs a place to belong. This is where life happens, where bonds are made over coffee &amp; conversations. We want to get back to the basics... back to relationships over social media, people over profit, giving back vs. taking, collaborations over competition, and family over an us vs. them mentality. This is our vision and while it may sounds lofty and we may not live up to all its expectations, the vision stays the same. Come flow with us.</p>
