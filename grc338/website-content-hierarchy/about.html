                <p>
                    WE ARE A FAMILY OWNED COFFEE SHOP WITH A TEAM CENTERED ON TREATING EVERYONE LIKE FAMILY. WE LIKE TO THINK OF OUR SPACE AS AN EXTENSION OF OUR LIVING ROOM OPEN TO WHOSOEVER NEEDS A PLACE TO BELONG. THIS IS WHERE LIFE
                    HAPPENS, WHERE BONDS ARE MADE OVER COFFEE & CONVERSATIONS. WE WANT TO GET BACK TO THE BASICSâ€¦ BACK TO RELATIONSHIPS OVER SOCIAL MEDIA, PEOPLE OVER PROFIT, GIVING BACK VS TAKING, COLLABORATIONS OVER COMPETITION, AND
                    FAMILY OVER AN US VS THEM MENTALITY. THIS IS OUR VISION AND WHILE IT MAY SOUND LOFTY AND WE MAY NOT LIVE UP TO ALL ITS EXPECTATIONS, THE VISION STAYS THE SAME. COME FLOW WITH US.
